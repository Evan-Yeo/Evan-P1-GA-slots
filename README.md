Tech used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

Approach Taken:

At the start did not used classes, but pivoted and decided to use class.
Started by listing out the class that is needed, followed by the functions that the classes should perform.
The naming and contents was difficult for me and had help from a friend to get it up.

The hard part is to make the reels spin and stop at random.
This was achieved by setting time out for each column.
Previously it will always stop at the same row of pictures.
Found out that it was the wrong approach as it is spinning together as a row.

Unsolved problems:
Finally, tried to set it so it will be easier for people to win but didnt manage to achieve because of time constraint.

References:
